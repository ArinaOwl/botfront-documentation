# Analytics

## Conversation length

This card displays the number of times a user interacted with the chatbot during a conversation. Conversations within the date range are grouped by the number of user utterances they contain. The number of user utterances is counted from the second as the first is usually sent by a smart trigger or an automatic event which is not related to a user engaging with the chatbot.

## Conversations over time
This card applies a set of filters to conversations of the selected type. The number of conversations of the selected type that match the filters are considered matching conversations and displayed on the chart in blue. The total number of conversations of the selected type, including conversations that do not match the filters are optionally displayed on the chart in red. Both matching and total conversations are grouped by the time of their last user utterance or bot response.

| Parameter             | What it does |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ** Show denominator ** | Display the total number of conversations of the selected type on the chart. |
| ** User initiated conversations ** | Filter the matching and total conversations by the first intent. Conversations with a non-trigger intent as the first intent are user initiated conversations. |
| ** Triggered conversations ** | Filter the matching and total conversations by the first intent. Conversations with a trigger intent as the first intent are triggered conversations. |
| ** Minimum number of utterances ** | Filter matching conversations by the number of user utterances in the conversation, counted from the second user utterance. |
| ** Filter intents and actions ** | Create a custom set of included and excluded intents and actions to filter the matching conversations displayed in the graph. |

## Conversation duration
This card displays conversations grouped by the amount of time between the first and the last user utterance or bot response in the conversation.

## Top intents
This card displays the number of times an intent was used in the selected date range. Intents sent by a smart trigger are excluded from this card.

| Parameter             | What it does |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ** Included intents ** | Only display intents that are listed in this filter |
| ** Excluded intents ** | Do not display intents listed in this filter |
| ** Display limit ** | Set a maximum number of intents to display on the bar or pie chart. This parameter does not affect the table view or the download. |

## Top triggers
This card displays the number of times a story with a smart trigger was activated by that trigger in the selected date range.

| Parameter             | What it does |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ** Display limit ** | Set a maximum number of triggered stories to display on the bar or pie chart. This parameter does not affect the table view or the download. |

## Action occurrences over time
This card displays the number of times an action was triggered in a conversation within the selected time period grouped by the conversation's end time

| Parameter             | What it does |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ** Included actions ** | Only count the actions added to this filter as action occurrences. |
| ** Excluded actions ** | Actions added to this filter will not be counted as action occurrences. |

## Conversations funnel
This card tracks engagement and drop-off over an ordered sequence of events. The matches are instances where the sequence of event inclusions and exclusions specified in the selected sequence filter are found in order in a conversation. The engagement of a triggered story can be measured by starting the selected sequence with the action or bot response that immediately follows the start of the story.

| Parameter             | What it does |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| ** Selected sequence ** | Add intents and actions to this filter by clicking on the button with a plus icon and selecting an event from the dropdown. Alternatively type the event you want to add into the search bar and press enter. Events in this filter can be marked as included (green) or excluded (red). To toggle between these options, click the event label in the sequence filter. |
| ** Selected sequence (inclusion) ** | Included events must be found in the conversation after all the previous events in the sequence. |
| ** Selected sequence (exclusion) ** | Excluded events must not be found between the previous event and the next event or the end of the conversation if it is the last event in the sequence. |
