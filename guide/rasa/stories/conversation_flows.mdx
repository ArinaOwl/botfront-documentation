# Conversation flows

## Branching conversations

Conversations are often designed as tree-like flow charts. Stories are _real_ conversation examples. Simply click on the **Branch Story** button on the story footer:

![Branching button](../../../images/branching_cob_1.png)

Several events can be at the beginning of branches:

- user utterances (intents and entities)
- slots (context)

### Branching with intents

The simplest way to branch a conversation is to use different intents at some point. Consider the following stories where two different paths (_happy_ and _sad_) are implemented:

![Branch 1: happy](../../../images/branching_cob_2.png)

![Branch 2: sad](../../../images/branching_cob_3.png)

### Branching with entity values

Another way is to use entity values. You can check how you can annotate with entities in the [conversation builder guide](/docs/rasa/conversation-builder/#annotating-with-entities).

Here we want to implement the following use case: a user can ask to book in _eco_ or _business_. The third path covers the case where no class is specified. This can be done as follows with branches:

![Branch 1: book-eco](../../../images/branching_cob_4.png)

<Important type="warning" title="But wait, that doesn't work!">

If you train and try this story, you'll see that if you type `/book` the agent will utter `utter_which_class` as expected, but if you type `/book{"class":"eco"}` or `/book{"class":"business"}` the response will be random. The reason is that if the value of the entity is not stored somewhere, Rasa only differentiates the flow looking at if the entity `class` exists or not in the user utterance.

If you want the stories above to work, you need to **create a slot**. In this case we're going to create a **categorical** slot, and add the categories **business** and **eco**. Then retrain and it should work.

</Important>

### Branching with slots

Once you define a slot with the same name as an entity, any entity value extracted from a user message will be set as the slot value, and this value will persist accross the conversation until it is changed or reset. This means that if a user said one of the sentences above (_I want to book in economy_ `book{"class":"eco"}` or _I want to book in business_`book{"class":"business"}`), you can still use that information to branch your conversation.

**Use case**: a user wants to cancel a booking, but only `business` bookings are cancellable. You can implement that as follows with branches:

![Branch 1: cancel-eco](../../../images/branching_cob_8.png)

![Branch 2: cancel-business](../../../images/branching_cob_9.png)

As you can see, the `- slot{"class":"..."}` in the branches guides the conversation into different paths.

<Important type="tip" title="What if the class has not been set yet?">

You can add a third category **not_set** to the `class` slot in a new branch, and set the initial value to **not_set**. Then you can gracefully handle the case where no class is set like this:

</Important>

### How branches are handled

Under the hood, Botfront uses [Rasa checkpoints](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/#checkpoints). When you click **branch story**, the parent and child stories are linked seamlessly with checkpoints, without the need of additional handling on the front end.

### Other branching features

You can easily see which branch you're on by looking at the breadcrumbs on the story footer:

![Branching breadcrumbs](../../../images/branching_11.png)

You can rename the branches as desired by clicking on the branch name and add as many as you want using the **+** icon:

![Rename branch](../../../images/branching_cob_12.png)

You can delete branches by clicking the trash icon while on the selected branch:

![Delete branch](../../../images/branching_cob_13.png)

<Important type="tip" title="NOTE">

Deleting either one of the last two branches would automatically delete the other branch as well. The content in the last remaining branch will be added to the parent story.

</Important>

## Linking stories

Linking stories is a powerful way to prevent repetition, and to easily connect stories with each other. You may simply select a story as a destination on the right side of the story footer. Any story can be linked to any story, or be used as a destination. This feature is especially useful where you would want to present a frequently repeated flow in the end of multiple stories, like a **feedback** flow.

![Link story](../../../images/linking_cob_1.png)

![Story linked](../../../images/linking_cob_2.png)

When a story is set as a destination, this is shown by a yellow information bar on the story header.

![Destination story](../../../images/linking_cob_3.png)

A list of linked stories would be available when clicked on the bar.

![Destination story detail](../../../images/linking_cob_4.png)

Stories that are destination stories or that have links cannot be deleted until the linking is removed.

![Destination story no delete](../../../images/linking_cob_5.png)

![Initial story no delete](../../../images/linking_cob_6.png)

Branches can be linked to other stories as well.

![Linked branch 1: Good](../../../images/linking_cob_7.png)

![Linked branch 2: Sad](../../../images/linking_cob_8.png)

<Important type="tip">

Using linking too much could overcomplicate your story flows, making them difficult to understand. Also, excessive usage could lead into an increase in training time.

</Important>

### Linking a story to itself

Linking a story to itself is only available on a story that has branches. For example, this can be used to create a menu dialogue, with a "go back" option looping back to the start of the story.
However, when using this feature, the story that is linking to itself also needs to be a destination story of another story, that will serve as an introduction story to the loop. **Otherwise, the self linking story would not be reachable.**

Schema of a self linking story (Menu story) with an intro story:

![Self linking schema](../../../images/story_self_link.png)

A sample self-linked story:

![Self-linked story](../../../images/linking_cob_9.png)

### How linking is handled

Similar to branching, Botfront uses [Rasa checkpoints](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/stories/#checkpoints) to accommodate linking as well. When you click **Link to**, the originating and destination stories are linked seamlessly with checkpoints. Please note that `> checkpoints` are not allowed in stories.
